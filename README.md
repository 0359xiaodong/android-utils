android-utils
=============

android-utils is a simple, small and fast framework for Android. It includes the following features:

* [UI Binding](docs/binding.md) - Supports **One-Way** (Model -> View) and **Two-Way** (Model <-> View) Binding. Allows you to bind objects, so called `Bindables`, to any kind of view and update the UI when those objects change. You can set the text of TextView's, change the background color or write your own `Bindings` which allows you to customize the UI actions.
